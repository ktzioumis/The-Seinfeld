# The Seinfeld!
Arguably the greatest sitcom ever made and certainly my most favourite show ever.

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld):
> Seinfeld is an American live-action sitcom created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld for NBC. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City, the show features a handful of Jerry Seinfeld's (as a fictionalized version of himself) friends and acquaintances, including best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), friend and former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). 

This quick description just scratches the surface of what Seinfeld was and still is; an iconic creation that is frequently ranked by publications such as 'Rolling Stone' and 'Entertainment Weekly' as one of the best comnedies ever made and voted by the 'Writers Guild of America' the No. 2 Best Written TV Series of All Time. Seinfeld has become a cultural touchstone and deeply embedded piece of the cultural zeitgeist spawning words like 'close-talker', catch-phrases like "It's gold, Jerry. Gold!", the truly unique "Elaine Dance" and even a new holiday "Festivus"! Seinfeld had an immeasurable impact on the pop-culture landscape but in this notebook, I plan to use Exploratory Data Analysis and Deep Learning on the complete scripts from the show's entire run  and do just a little bit of measuring.

## The Larry David
Larry David was by far the show's most prolific writer, credited on a third of the total episodes produced. By using a a Keras Deep Learning Model with Natural Language Processing can we tease out Larry David's signature in the dialogue of Seinfeld?
