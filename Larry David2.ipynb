       "\"so, im on line at the supermarket. two women in front of me. one of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. they both of course choose to pay by the use of the... cheque. cheque. now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. i have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. the keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. they never fumble for the cheque book. the cheque book comes out of a holster (jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) who do i make it out to? theres my id. theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. i dont know exactly what it is. i think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, i dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, im sure theyll stick up for me... if you just trust me this one time- i dont have any money but i have these. i wrote on these. is this of any value at all? whats that one? coccoon ii the return. i guess they didnt like it up there. maybe they came back for chinese food. yknow maureen stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, i gotta have a lo mein! okay, whatre we doing here? i have seen everything. oh yeah? i dont believe youve seen... this. oh, lovely. yeah. what do you think their parents think? so, uh, whats your son doing now, dr. stevens? oh, hes a public fornicator. yes, hes a fine boy... yknow what? this would be a really funny gift for pamelas birthday. pamela? do i know her? yeah, you met her when we were going out. oh yeah, right... you have no idea who im talking about, do you?

(a lightbulb goes on in his head) riverside drive. right! in fact... no, never mind... well, what is it? well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no. wait a second, wait a second. we could work out a little deal here. what little deal? i will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding i have on saturday. a wedding? have you lost it, man? yknow, my parents are coming in for this... theyre coming in? yeah, tomorrow. hey, did your father ever get that hair weave? no, no. still doin the big sweep across. why does he do that? doesnt think anyone can tell. so cmon, do we have a deal? a wedding? theres a lot of people to mock... all right, what the hell. great! when youre dead, youre dead. thats it. youre not goin anywhere... cmon lets go... was i supposed to bring something? you could have. i met her one time... it is not necessary. what did you say then? sssshhhhhh!!! hi hi, pamela, you remember jerry. (shakes jerry's hand) yes, we met. hi, happy birthday. thanks, ah, everybody, this is elaine and jerry. hi i didnt bring anything. uh, i put you two right here. oh, okay (turns to rest of table) im sorry, i didnt know what to bring, nobody told me. how big a tip do you think itd take to get him to stop? im in for five... ill supply the hat.

(tries turning away in the hopes elaine gets the hint; thinking) oh god, i gotta get out of this. you were you, but, you werent you... no kidding. (thinking) why is this happening? please, make her stop! i think, i think we were in my house where i grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window... (thinking) this is brutal. you turned around and you had these wooden teeth. how do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)can i turn now? is this over? no, i cant, i cant. im stuck. (noticing jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) jerry? are you listening to me? yes, i heard you. elaine, whats the name of that jewelry store you took me to that time? (thinking) thank you, pamela!

(thinking) i cant believe it. i got nothing! i dont even know her name! sagman, bennet, robbins, oppenheim and taft. sagman, bennet, robbins, oppen... sagman... sag... that wasnt so bad, really. yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners. why? what did i do? wel-well, i just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like im selling you aluminum siding. i was listening! no! you couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation. no, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had. uh-huh... where you had, uh, wooden teeth. no! no! you had wooden teeth! you had wooden teeth! i didnt have wooden teeth, you did! all right, so i had wooden teeth, so what? so nothing! nothing. (annoyed sigh) apparently plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. he named it after himself. he said, yeah, i got this new thing platonic. my idea, my name, callin it after myself. what i do is, i go out with the girls, i talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. whatd you think? i think its going to be big! i bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didnt work. yknow, i bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, uh, hi, uh my names rico. would you like to go to bed immediately? hey, its a riconic relationship. hey! ah, there he is! this is what i like, see? you come home and your parents are in your bed! yknow, jerry, we dont have to do this. what are you talkin about? its fine, i love having you here. tomorrow well go to a hotel. ma, will you stop? no, why should we take over your apartment? i dont care. im sleeping next door. your friend kramer doesnt mind? no, hes making a bouillabaisse. so, dad, lemme ask you a question. how many people work at these big law offices? depends on the firm. yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was? whats the matter? you need a lawyer? no, i met someone at this party, and i know where she works, but i dont know her name. so why dont you ask someone who was at the party? nah, the only one i could ask is elaine, and i cant ask her. why not? because its complicated. theres some tension there. he used to go with her. which one is she? from maryland. the one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like. oh yeah, very alert. warm person. oh yeah, shes great. so, how come nothing materialized there? well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. i dunno... i know what it was. you dont know what it was. so, what was it? well, we fight a lot for some reason. oh, well... and there was a little problem with the physical chemistry. well, i think shes a very attractive girl. oh, she is, she absolutely is. i can see if there was a weight problem... no, its not that. it wasnt all one-sided. you know, you cant be so particular. nobodys perfect. i know, i know... yknow jerry, its a good thing i wasnt so particular. (hits morty) idiot. (to jerry) so whore you looking for, sophia loren? thats got nothin to do with it. how about loni anderson? where do you get loni anderson? why, whats wrong with loni anderson? i like elaine more than loni anderson. what are you two talking about? look, elaine just wasnt the one. and this other ones the one? i dunno, maybe... so ask elaine there for her number. i cant. shell get upset. i never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight. how could you still see her if your not interested? were friends. doesnt sound like youre friends to me. if you were friends you'd-youd ask her for the number. do you know where this other one works? oh yeah. well, go up to the office. up to her office? go to the building. she goes out to lunch, doesnt she? i guess. so, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch. you mean stakeout the lobby? morty, thats ridiculous. just ask elaine for the number! he doesnt want to ask elaine for the number. so youve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! what happens when he sees her? he pretends he bumped into her! yknow what? this is not that bad an idea. what does she look like? i dunno. hard to say. what actress does she remind you of? loni anderson. loni anderson?! what, theres something wrong with loni anderson?

(to kramer) why did you make me put that down? nah, we need a medical dictionary! if a patient gets difficult, you quone him. you want some funny material, you oughta come down to where i work, now thats a sitcom! you must have quite a time down there. we got plenty of time. oh, im sorry. im just waiting for someone. watch what you say to this guy. hell put it in his next act! yeah, yeah... jerry, did i tell you that im writing a book? an autobiography. yeah, uncle mac, you mentioned it. its based on all my experiences! thats perfect. could you excuse me one second? im sorry. how do you do? (introducing himself) uh, jerry seinfeld. oh, how do you do? elaine benes. um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car? oh no, lets do it now. all right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain- okay. jerry, were you goin with us? no, im gonna take my car. thats why i brought the wagon. why the hell did i bring the wagon? anyway, you know why i didnt ask you, i mean i felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab. well, jerry, i never saw you flirt with anyone before. it was quite the spectacle. jerry, well see you there. bye, elaine. oh, bye. good to see you. oh, we didnt meet. oh, im sorry. elaine, this is my cousin, artie levine. (correcting jerry) levine. (sarcastically) yeah, levine. and im jerry cougar mellencamp. anyway, i admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but i mean, i mean, obviously we have a little problem here. yeah, obviously. i mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people. couldnt agree more. good. good. good. great! great? where do you get great? its great to... talk about... other people... ...guys? yeah. uh-huh. yeah. so, anybody specific? no. a general guy. oh really? elaine marie benes... what? no, its not a big deal. no, thats great! thats terrific! no, we just met... doesnt matter. whats the young mans name? i would like to meet him. hmmm, i dont think so. well, what does he do? is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort? wall street. ah, high finance. bulls, bears, people from conneticut. and he happens to be pretty good lookin. (pause) all right, sir. and... hes hilarious. now thats not fair! so where did you meet this guy? i staked out his health club. uh huh. when youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant? yknow i think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. isnt this? its hard. because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. the one goes, look, a rabbit. the other goes, so? i believe this is your card. look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?\""
